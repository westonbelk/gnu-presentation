## Why was it created?

* Richard Stallman watched a community he loved crumble
* He was fed up with proprietary software
* Wanted to recreate that community that he loved
	- Decided to write a free operating system
	- Free as in freedom

---

## Philosophy

* What is free?
	- Free as in beer ($$$$)
	- Free as in freedom
	- Freedom does not imply free as in price
	- Freedom means:
		- Free to use however
		- Whenever
		- On whatever
		- Source code is available
		- You can do *what you want to do*

---

## How

* The problem with other free software licenses
	- Wrong goals
	- Too permissive
* The solution: Copyleft!
	- Not the opposite of copyright
	- Uses copyright as a means for keeping the software free
	- Permissions to do anything except for adding restrictions
	- Infectious: Modified versions must also be free

---

## Some GNU Licenses

* GNU General Public License (GPL)
	- Most well-known license
	- Can cause licensing issues in large projects
	- Enterprise tends to avoid

* Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL)
	- Mainly intended for libraries (though gnu.org will tell you otherwise)
	- Allows proprietary software to link to the software

---

## Impact on Computing

* Helped lead to the popularity GNU/Linux systems
	- When you think Linux you think GNU Coreutils
	- GNU/Linux is dominant in the server world
* Some of the best software
	- Web servers
	- Source control
	- Compilers

## Community Impact

* Stallman got his community back
* _

## Ethical Issues with Free Software

* Utilitarian Perspective
	- Does it discourage innovation?
	- What is the balance?
* Fairness Perspective

---

## Ethical Issues with the GNU Project

* Is copyleft really free?
	- Compared to the MIT License
	- Compared to public domain
